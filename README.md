Content based algorithm attempts to figure out the user's favourite aspects of an item and then recommends similar items that includes those aspects. In this project, attributes such as genre, top 3 actors of the movie, overview/plot, director, and keywords representing the movie are used to make suggestions for the users. These features can provide a great insight on understanding users' preferences and help to produce better movie recommendations that are similar to their chosen movie.
